# Suspicious input detection

This analyzes N8N Workflow using Greynoise data and records the incoming IP addresses and records it to the postgresql database according to the priority level.

## Workflow Description
! [Greynoise] (https://i.imgur.com/4vswtky.png)

In the Workflow, the `graperaise` node queries IP addresses in NOISE and RIOT data sets.According to the results, warning levels are determined by means of `priority` nodes.Thus, your security team can give priority to the most critical threats.

### authentication
Since there is no free plan for Greynoise, you need to get your API switch from [Greynoise] (https://www.greynoise.io/).By opening the `grarenoise` node, define the key name ** key ** with the` header auth` method to have your own API switch.

## Usage steps
In the 1. N8N interface, use the ** Import **.
2. Update the required ID information and parameters according to your own environment.
3. Workflow ** Activate ** run the automation.
## Detailed user manual

If you are going to run this Workflow file for the first time, follow the steps below.

1. ** Set up N8n **
- `NPM` Method:` NPX N8N` command can run in the local environment.
-Docker Method: `Docker Run -it -Rm -p 5678: 5678 N8nio/n8n` `run.
- Then access the N8N editor by accessing `http: // localhost: 5678` from your browser.
2. ** Import Workflow **
- In the editor, click `Import from File` from the ** Import ** menu at the top right.
- Select and save the relevant JSON file in this repo.
3. ** Define identity information **
- Every node processing in Workflow needs the API switch to connect to the relevant service.
- Open Node and create a new identity information from the Credendials ** section or select the existing.
4. ** Customize parameters **
- Enter your own values into the required areas (Webhook URL, Keywords, Timer, etc.).
5. ** Run and verify **
- Perform the test by saying ** Execute Workflow ** from the top menu.
- If you get the expected results, take the automation by saying ** Activate **.
6. ** In case of error **
- You can review the logs from the `Executions' tab and try it again by correcting faulty nodes.
7. ** Review the logs and save progress **
- After the test execution, you can see the output of each step on the `Executions` page.
- If necessary, you can keep a detailed log by opening ** Save Execution Progress ** option.
8. ** Personalize Workflow according to your needs **
- You can expand the flow by copying the nodes and changing the parameters.
- After changes, say ** Execute Workflow ** and check the result.

### Special Settings (2014)
1. You need access to a postgresql database.Enter your server, user name and password information in the `Postgres' node ** Credendials ** section.
2.
3. Open the `Greynoise` node and add the API switch you have created by ** Header Auth ** method (key name` key`).
4. Question the outgoing IP addresses in incoming and outgoing;You can run an example for the test by entering an example and observe that priority values are correct.
